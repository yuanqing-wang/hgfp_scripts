Warning: Unable to load toolkit 'OpenEye Toolkit'. The Open Force Field Toolkit does not require the OpenEye Toolkits, and can use RDKit/AmberTools instead. However, if you have a valid license for the OpenEye Toolkits, consider installing them for faster performance and additional file format support: https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/quickstart-python/linuxosx.html OpenEye offers free Toolkit licenses for academics: https://www.eyesopen.com/academic-licensing

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
